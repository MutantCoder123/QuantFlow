# QuantFlow Change Specsheet

Running record of every change made during implementation: what changed, why, how it was verified,
and anything a future reader needs to know. Updated as each task lands.

**Plan:** [docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-09-quantflow-remediation-and-measurability.md](docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-09-quantflow-remediation-and-measurability.md)
**Tasks:** [IMPLEMENTATION_TASKS.md](IMPLEMENTATION_TASKS.md)
**Branch:** `feat/measurability` (base: `master` @ `011eec0`)

---

## Environment baseline (measured at start)

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Python | 3.12.10 |
| pandas | 3.0.3 — **copy-on-write is default** |
| numpy | 2.2.6 |
| pyarrow | 24.0.0 |
| TA-Lib | 0.6.8 |
| fastapi | 0.136.1 |
| google-genai | 2.6.0 |
| pytest / PyYAML / freezegun | **absent at start** — installed in Task 0.1 |
| Existing tests | none |

### Workspace decision

The plan and the `executing-plans` skill both default to a git worktree. **Not used here**, deliberately:
`trading_copilot/data/` (all parquet files, `macro_baselines.json`) and `.env` are **untracked**, so a
worktree checkout would omit them and Task 0.2's verification would fail for the wrong reason.
Work proceeds on branch `feat/measurability` in the existing working tree; tracked changes are isolated,
untracked runtime data stays in place.

## Conventions adopted

- All filesystem paths come from `trading_copilot/paths.py`. No new `os.path.dirname(__file__)` chains.
- Timezone-aware IST via `zoneinfo.ZoneInfo("Asia/Kolkata")`. No `datetime.utcnow()`, no hand-added offsets.
- Unknown values propagate as `None` and render as unknown. Never substitute a plausible-looking default.
- Every behavioural change lands with a test that failed before it and passes after.
